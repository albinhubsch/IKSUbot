#IKSUbot
The IKSUbot is a robot that automates class booking at the IKSU training center. It can be really hard to get a spot at popular classes like Indoor Walking or Total Training. This robot solves this by automatically sign you in and book the desired class as soon as they are released and open for booking. It can't guarantee a place but the probability of every spot being taken at the exact moment of release is very low.
